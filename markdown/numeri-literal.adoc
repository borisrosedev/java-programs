= Underscore characters

== Introduction

In Java SE 7 and later, any number of underscore characters (_) can appear anywhere between digits in a numerical literal. 

== Goal

This feature enables you, for example. to separate groups of digits in numeric literals, which can improve the readability of your code.

=== Example

For instance, if your code contains numbers with many digits, you can use an underscore character to separate digits in groups of three, similar to how you would use a punctuation mark like a comma, or a space, as a separator.

=== ...

The following example shows other ways you can use the underscore in numeric literals:
