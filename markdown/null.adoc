= Special null literal

There is also a special null literal that can be used as a value for any reference type. 

The null literal may be assigned to any variable, except variables of primitive types. 

There is little you can do with a null value beyond testing for its presence. 

Therefore, null is often used in programs as a marker to indicate that some object is unavailable.
